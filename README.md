## How does the game work?
A random 5 letter word is chosen and you are given 6 attempts to guess the word.  
Each letter is evaluated and will give you clues to help you towards the answer.  
A '*' means that the corresponding letter is in the word, but not in that position.  
A '!' means that the corresponding letter is in the word, and is in the correct position.
